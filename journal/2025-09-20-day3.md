# Journal — {{9-20-2025}} — {{DAY 3}}

## 1) What I learned (bullets, not prose)
- Data modeling
- Remote collaborative working
- Handling larger, messier data
- Modeling event-based and aggregated facts

## 2) New vocabulary (define in your own words)
- **Star Schema** — way of designing a data warehouse with one big fact table in the center and smaller dimension tables around it.
- **Bridges** — connect tables in a many-to-many relationships.
- **Hierarchies** — represents data organized in levels.
- 


## 3) Data Engineering mindset applied (what principles did I use?)
- **Communicate clearly:** — sought help with peers and SIs as needed.

## 4) Decisions & assumptions (why, alternatives, trade-offs)
- I did more test queries on DBeaver to see how different factors interact each other in the new dataset provided. 

## 5) Open questions (things I still don’t get)
- Why not just use the tables ingested by other groups in the activity? 

## 6) Next actions (small, doable steps)
- [ ] - Catch up with all the technicalities
- [ ] - Practice more SQL queries
- [ ] - Keep up w DataCamp streak
- [ ] - Finish group assignment

## 7) Artifacts & links (code, queries, dashboards)
- Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD) Dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/349/open+university+learning+analytics+dataset

### Mini reflection (3–5 sentences)
In our group activity which involved ingesting OULAD data, I struggled to contribute effectively because I had difficulty using dlt and dbt. This made me realize that I lacked some prerequisite knowledge and technical skills needed for the task. Although it was frustrating at first, I took it as an opportunity to identify my weak areas. I am now practicing more consistently so I can catch up and contribute better in future group work.
### BONUS: What is a meme that best describes what you feel or your learning today?
