# Journal — {{10-11-2025}} — {{DAY 5}}

## 1) What I learned (bullets, not prose)
- Data Lifescylce
- Data Types, Formats, Storage Trade-offs
- Pandas
- APIs
- Webscraping
- Data Ethics

## 2) New vocabulary (define in your own words)
- **APIs** — accuracy, completeness, reliability, relevancy, timeliness
- **pandas** — snapshot of dataset quality.
- **Webscraping** —
  
## 3) Data Engineering mindset applied (what principles did I use?)
- **Monitoring Data Quality:** — learned about data formats and what they entail.

## 4) Decisions & assumptions (why, alternatives, trade-offs)
- The class was introduced to the idea of pulling data from various sources and ingeting them to a destination file (csv). 

## 5) Open questions (things I still don’t get)
- Just how much coding is involved in data engineering?

## 6) Next actions (small, doable steps)
- [ ] - Catch up with all the technicalities
- [ ] - Practice more SQL queries
- [ ] - Keep up w DataCamp streak

## 7) Artifacts & links (code, queries, dashboards)

### Mini reflection (3–5 sentences)
The data lifecycle, from collection and cleaning to analysis, storage, and sharing, requires careful attention at every stage to ensure accuracy and reliability. Alongside technical responsibilities, data ethics is crucial because it guides how we handle sensitive information, respect privacy, and prevent misuse. Balancing effective data management with ethical considerations allows us to make responsible, trustworthy decisions that benefit both organizations and individuals.
