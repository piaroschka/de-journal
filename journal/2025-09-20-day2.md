# Journal — {{9-20-2025}} — {{DAY 2}}

## 1) What I learned (bullets, not prose)
- More SQL functions
- Data modeling
- Chinook Database
- Entity-Relationship Model
- Keys
- Database Normalization

## 2) New vocabulary (define in your own words)
- **Database normalization** — organizing data in a database in a way that removes redundancy/duplicates.
- **Star Schema** — way of designing a data warehouse with one big fact table in the center and smaller dimension tables around it.
- **Dimensional Modeling** — data design technique that structures data into fact tables with quantitative measurements and dimension tables; approach behind star schemas.
- **Fact** — table that stores measurable qualities.
- **Dimension** — table that gives descriptive context to facts.


## 3) Data Engineering mindset applied (what principles did I use?)
- **Communicate clearly:** — sought help with peers and SIs as needed.

## 4) Decisions & assumptions (why, alternatives, trade-offs)
- I did more test queries on DBeaver to see how different factors interact each other in the new dataset provided (Chinook). 

## 5) Open questions (things I still don’t get)
- How much coding is actually involved in the DE industry? Asking as someone with 0 baseline knowledge.
- What are the pros and cons of working remotely vs locally?
- How important is SQL compared to Python in everyday DE tasks?  

## 6) Next actions (small, doable steps)
- [ ] - Catch up with all the technicalities
- [ ] - Practice running SQL queries
- [ ] - Practice SQL queries using different datasets
- [ ] - Finish Datacamp assignments
- [ ] - Finish group assignment

## 7) Artifacts & links (code, queries, dashboards)
- N/A

### Mini reflection (3–5 sentences)
I was yet again overwhelmed by all of the tech stuff involved. I am slowly getting the conceptual connections between and among the things that we have discussed so far, but I am still facing challenges. I might need to brush up on a lot of things. Next time, I will anticipate what I have to know so I will be more ready for the discussion.

### BONUS: What is a meme that best describes what you feel or your learning today?
